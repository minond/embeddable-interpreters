// > Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban
// MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism. The language consists of
// only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully
// Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use...

// ## Setup

// Helper functions. We need to know if we should use browser or node apis for
// i/o. The following functions are read and write implementations for specific
// environments. They include: a write function for node; a write function for
// browsers; a read function for node; a read function for browsers; a generic
// read function. Use this in the interpreter; and a generic write function.
// Use this in the interpreter.
import { ReadBuffer, StringInput, read, write, isset, call, pass } from "./common";

// ## The interpreter
const exec = (prog: string, userHooks?: Hooks, buff?: ReadBuffer) => {
  // First, split the program into an array of characters so we can take action
  // upon each of them one by one. That is stores in `cmds`. Then store the
  // number of "commands" so that we know when to stop and not have to check
  // the `.length` property over and over again. That is stored in `len`.
  const cmds = prog.split('')
  const len = cmds.length

  // Now to the state variables. First, two less important ones: `steps` is
  // used to track how many times the `dump` function has been called and `cmd`
  // is the local variable of the current command we are processing. This is a
  // local variable, so there is no need to pass it around to functions that
  // are in the state of the interpreter.
  var steps = 0

  // The rest of the state variables: `jumps` is a stack of loop starting
  // indexes. See `[` and `]` operators.  `memory` is where we store the memory
  // cells of our program.  `pointer` this is where we are pointing to in
  // memory. Always starts at zero.  Finally, `ids` tracks the index of where
  // we are in the program.

  // Some helper small functions. `curr` is used for getting the current value
